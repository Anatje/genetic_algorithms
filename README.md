# genetic algorithms

Contains a presentation, code examples and exercises to do with genetic algorithms.

## Code

The code folder contains scripts that use genetic algorithms to do a kind of optimization task. 

* to_be contains scripts that will solve the infinite monkey theorem.
* frozen_lake solves the frozenlake maze from the gym python package
* traveling_salesman has no implementation of a genetic algorithm yet, only the brute force solution has been implemented.
* notebooks contains the notebooks derived from the to_be and frozen_lake scripts.

## Presentation

The presentation has been made using reveal.js. The code is in index.html, example JS scripts in "to_be" and "rockets". All images are saved in "imgs". To open the presentation, create a local server from within the presentation folder, for example:

```
python -m http.server
```

## Exercises

Two jupyter notebooks with unfinished code.
